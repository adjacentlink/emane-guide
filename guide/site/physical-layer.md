# Physical Layer

The *EMANE* physical layer model (*physical layer*) is central to all
emulator functionality. Designed to be flexible and universally used
by all radio models, the physical layer is key to providing a
realistic emulated electromagnetic operating environment for
heterogeneous waveform experimentation.

## Features

The physical layer provides the following set of features, some of
which are utilized by all radio models while others are only utilized
by radio models that are designed and coded for their use:
[Heterogeneous Model Interaction](#heterogeneous-model-interaction),
[Propagation Model](#propagation-model), [Receive Power
Calculation](#receive-power-calculation), [Antenna
Gain](#antenna-gain), [Noise Processing](#noise-processing),
[Frequency Diversity](#frequency-diversity), [Collaborative
Transmission](#collaborative-transmission), [Multiple-Input
Multiple-Output (MIMO)](#mimo), [Fading Model](#fading-model),
[Spectral Masks](#spectral-masks), and [Spectrum
Filters](#spectrum-filters).

Physical layer features are controllable via a combination of start-up
and running-state modifiable configuration, events, and control
message exchanges with a respective radio model. The physical layer
operates in one of two API modes: *compatibly mode 1* (*compat1*) and
*compatibility mode 2* (*compat2*).

*Compatibility mode 1* is a legacy non-MIMO API mode that supports
radio model control messaging for single antenna functionality.  This
API mode was the sole mode available prior to *EMANE* 1.3.x. While
still supported, the use of this mode by newly developed radio models
is deprecated.

*Compatibility mode 2* is the newer MIMO API mode and supports radio
model control messaging for MIMO. New radio models should use the
*compatibility mode 2* API, even if not modeling MIMO
features. Regardless of the API mode in use, physical layer instances
of the same version of *EMANE* are over-the-air compatible.

### Heterogeneous Model Interaction

Physical layer instances are interconnected using an over-the-air
multicast channel. All over-the-air transmissions are processed by
every emulator instance using the same over-the-air channel. This is
how the emulator physical layer accounts for signal propagation,
antenna effects and interference sources across heterogeneous radio
models.

Each over-the-air transmission has a *Common Physical Layer Header*
prepended. This header is what enables the physical layer to account
for spectrum energy from *in-band* (same) and *out-of-band*
(different) waveform sources.

```protobuf
syntax = "proto2";
package EMANEMessage;
option optimize_for = SPEED;

    required uint32 nemId = 1;
    required double powerdBm = 2;

  optional bytes filterData = 8;
}
```
<p style="float:right;font-family:courier;font-size:75%">emane/src/libemane/commonphyheader.proto</p><br>

As we learn about each physical layer feature, we will highlight what
if any information in support of that feature is contained in the
*Common Physical Layer Header*. The following header contents are used
in general to identify and process an over-the-air message:

1. `registrationId`: Identifies the over-the-air transmission as being
    an emulator physical layer message.

2. `subId`: Identifies the over-the-air transmission as being from an
    *in-band* or *out-of-band* waveform. An over-the-air message
    matching the `subid` configuration parameter of the receiver and
    using frequencies that match the `frequencyofinterest`
    configuration parameter or the frequency of interest set
    associated with a receive antenna configured via control message ,
    is considered *in-band*.

3. `sequenceNumber`: Unique sequence number incremented for every
   over-the-air transmission.

4. `txTimeMicroseconds`: over-the-air *start-of-transmission* (SOT)
   time stamp.

### Propagation Model

Pathloss within the physical layer model is based on [`LocationEvents`](events#locationevent) or
[`PathlossEvents`](events#pathlossevent).  Pathloss is dynamically
calculated based on location when the `propagationmodel` configuration
parameter is set to either `2ray` or `freespace`, which selects
between the 2-ray flat earth or freespace propagation models,
respectively.

Pathloss can be provided in realtime based on external propagation
calculations using [`PathlossEvents`](events#pathlossevent). The `propagationmodel` configuration
parameter should be set to `precomputed` in order to process [`PathlossEvents`](events#pathlossevent).

### Receive Power Calculation

For each received over-the-air transmission, the physical layer
computes the receive power associated with that transmission using the
following calculation:

$$rxPower = txPower + txAntennaGain + rxAntennaGain - pathloss$$

Where,

* $$txPower$$ is provided in the *Common Physical Layer Header*
  via `transmitters[i].powerdBm` and optionally overridden by the
  `frequencyGroups[j].frequencySegments[k].powerdBm`. Set at the
  transmitter using the `txpower` configuration parameter and
  overridden by a radio model using [`TransmitterControlMessage`](control-messages#transmittercontrolmessage) (*compat1*) or [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage) (*compat2*).
  
* $$txAntennaGain$$ is provided in the *Common Physical Layer
  Header* via `transmitAntennas[i].fixedGaindBi` when using an ideal
  omni antenna with fixed gain or determined using
  `transmitAntennas[i].{profileId, azimuthDegrees, elevationDegrees}`
  when using a profile defined antenna.

* $$rxAntennaGain$$ is provided via the `fixedantennagain` and
  `fixedantennagainenable` configuration parameters or calculated
  using the receiver's current antenna profile when using profile
  defined antennas. When using a profile defined antenna, it is
  calculated from an external [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) sent to all
  *NEMs* or by a radio model using [`AntennaProfileControlMessage`](control-messages#antennaprofilecontrolmessage) (*compat1*) or [`RxAntennaAddControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaaddcontrolmessage) and [`RxAntennaUpdateControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaupdatecontrolmessage) (*compat2*).

* $$pathloss$$ is the pathloss between transmitter and receiver
  determined based on the [propagation model](#propagation-model)
  specified via the `propagationmodel` configuration parameter.

If the $$rxPower$$ is less than the $$rxSensitivity$$,
the message is discarded.

$$rxSensitivity = -174 + noiseFigure + 10log(bandwidth)$$

Where,

* $$bandwidth$$ is defined by the configuration parameter
  `bandwidth`.

* $$noiseFigure$$ is defined by the configuration parameter
  `systemnoisefigure`.

### Antenna Gain

Antenna gain for a given *NEM* is defined via configuration using one
of two methods: *fixed gain* or *antenna profile*.

Fixed antenna gain specifies the antenna gain for a given *NEM* to be
used for all transmissions and receptions. To use a fixed antenna
gain, the `fixedantennagainenable` configuration parameter must be set
to `on` and the `fixedantennagain` configuration parameter must be set
to the desired antenna gain in dBi. Both of these parameters are
optional and the default configuration is to use a fixed antenna gain
of 0 dBi. An *NEM* configured to use a fixed antenna gain uses the
configured gain as the $$rxAntennaGain$$ for all over-the-air
received transmissions when computing $$rxPower$$. For all
over-the-air transmissions, the *NEM* indicates the use of fixed
antenna gain by specifying the gain value within the *Common Physical
Layer Header* via `transmitAntennas[i].fixedGaindBi`.

Antenna profiles use gain patterns, defined via XML, as a function of
elevation and azimuth based on the transmitting and receiving *NEM*
location and orientation (pitch, roll, yaw). Location and orientation
are communicated using [`LocationEvents`](events#location-event). Each *NEM* must be
aware of the antenna profile and pointing information of all *NEM*s
transmitting using antenna profiles. This antenna profile information
is communicated to all *NEMs* using either [`AntennaProfileEvents`](events#antennaprofileevent) or as part of the *Common Physical
Layer Header*: `transmitAntennas[i].{profileId, azimuthDegrees,
elevationDegrees}`.

An [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) is used to communicate the antenna
profile index and pointing information for an *NEM's* default
antenna. Radio models using *compat1* only have a single antenna
(default) which uses an antenna index of 0. There is no mechanism to
add additional antenna in *compat1* and there is no notion of
specifying which antenna index is applicable for a received [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) -- the event *always* corresponds to
antenna index 0.

An [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) is generated externally via the
event service or directly via the physical layer when a *compat1*
radio model sends the physical layer an [`AntennaProfileControlMessage`](control-messages#antennaprofilecontrolmessage) to change the antenna
profile and/or pointing. An [`AntennaProfileControlMessage`](control-messages#antennaprofilecontrolmessage) can be specified along with
any over-the-air message in the downstream direction. When the
physical layer receives an [`AntennaProfileControlMessage`](control-messages#antennaprofilecontrolmessage) from a radio model, it will
create an [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) and transmit the event in one of two
ways:

1. If the [`AntennaProfileControlMessage`](control-messages#antennaprofilecontrolmessage) was sent as part of a
   downstream over-the-air message, the [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) will be attached to the
   over-the-air message and transmitted as rider with the over-the-air
   message. All *NEMs* will process the [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) prior to processing the
   over-the-air message.

2. If the [`AntennaProfileControlMessage`](control-messages#antennaprofilecontrolmessage) was sent as part of a
   downstream control message, the [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) will be sent using the event
   multicast channel.

An [`AntennaProfileControlMessage`](control-messages#antennaprofilecontrolmessage)
message sets both the receive and transmit antenna profile and
pointing for the default antenna, which differs from how the MIMO API
(*compat2*) works.

For *compat2* radio models, the [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage)
*should* accompany every downstream over-the-air message, and contains
a list of transmit antennas with their respective profile and pointing
information. If the [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage) is missing,
the physical layer falls back on *compat1* mechanisms for using the
default antenna. The *Common Physical Layer Header* contains all the
transmit antenna profile and antenna pointing information. In
*compat2*, the physical layer never generates an [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent).

The MIMO API requires adding, updating, and removing receive
antenna. The physical layer does not keep track of transmit antenna,
only receive antenna. So if a radio model wants to control the profile
and pointing of an antenna used for both receive and transmit, an
[`RxAntennaUpdateControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaupdatecontrolmessage)
must accompany the [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage), and contain the
same profile and pointing information.

To use antenna patterns, the `fixedantennagainenable` configuration
parameter must be set to `off` and the emulator's
`antennaprofilemanifesturi` configuration parameter must be set
accordingly.

If antenna profiles are being used by one or more *NEMs* within the
emulation, the `antennaprofilemanifesturi` configuration parameter
must be configured for all emulator instances (including those
instances with an *NEM* configured to use a fixed antenna gain). This
is required to allow an *NEM* to determine the *txAntennaGain* when
performing the [receive power
calculation](#receive-power-calculation).

### Noise Processing

The physical layer provides the ability to assess the impact of
intentional and unintentional noise sources within the emulation by
adjusting the noise floor. This is achieved by summing the energy of
signals within the appropriate frequency of interest over a given time
interval and reporting a spectrum window containing received signal
energy to a requesting radio model. A radio model *must* wait until
the transmission end-of-reception time before requesting a spectrum
window over a desired time period.

Each receive antenna, whether the default (*compat1*) or added with
[`RxAntennaAddControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaaddcontrolmessage) (*compat2*), has its own view
of the spectrum which internally maps to a dedicated physical layer
*Spectrum Monitor* instance. A *Spectrum Monitor* instance monitors
the antenna's frequency of interest set using a series of energy
recorders to keep track of encountered signal energy over time.

![](images/spectrumservice.png){:width="90%"; .centered}

Energy recorders use a logical wheel of bins, where bin width in
microseconds is set using the configuration parameter:
`noisebinsize`. Each over-the-air transmission is checked for
frequency overlap using the transmitter and receiver bandwidth. If
there is any overlap, a proportional amount of signal energy is
applied to each corresponding energy recorder wheel starting at the
transmission start-of-reception:

$startOfReception = startOfTransmission + propagation + frequencySegmentOffset_0$

Where,

* $$startOfTransmission$$ is the start-of-transmission in
  microseconds contained in the *Common Physical Layer Header*:
  `txTimeMicroseconds`.

* $$propagation$$ is the propagation delay calculated when the
  location of the transmitting *NEM* and receiving *NEM* is known via
  [`LocationEvents`](events#locationevent), or 0 when any respective location is
  unknown.

* $$frequencySegmentOffset_0$$ is the offset in microseconds of
  the first frequency segment conveyed via the *Common Physical Layer
  Header*:
  `frequencyGroups[j].frequencySegments[0].offsetMicroseconds`.

Physical layer configuration parameters: `noisemaxsegmentduration`,
`noisemaxmessagepropagation`, and `noisemaxsegmentoffset` are used to
set the maximum duration, propagation delay, and frequency segment
offset, all in microseconds, respectively. By default, over-the-air
transmissions containing values above the configured maximums will be
dropped.

The physical layer has the ability to record *all* signal energy,
*out-of-band* signal energy, or *no* signal energy determined by the
configuration parameter `noisemode` value `all`, `outofband`, or
`none`, respectively. When no signal energy is being recorded or no
signal energy occurred over a given request interval, the receiver
sensitivity is used as the noise floor.

When recording all signal energy, it is the radio model's
responsibility to remove the in-band signal from the spectrum window
prior to computing the SINR.

The spectrum service can also be utilized by a radio model to support
Dynamic Spectrum Access (*DSA*) by requesting a spectrum window over a
valid time interval independent of an upstream over-the-air reception.

A radio model queries spectrum monitor energy using
[`SpectrumServiceProvider::requestAntenna`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/spectrumserviceprovider.h#L168):

```cpp
auto spectrumWindow =
  pRadioService_->spectrumService().requestAntenna(0, // antenna index
                                                   u64FrequencyHz,
                                                   span,
                                                   startOfReception);

```

Where, the returned spectrum window is a [`SpectrumWindow`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/spectrumserviceprovider.h#L63) instance.

### Frequency Diversity

The physical layer provides the ability to send multiple signals (of
constant bandwidth) in frequency and/or time within a single
over-the-air message. A *compat1* radio model can utilize this feature
by populating the [`FrequencyControlMessage`](control-messages#frequencycontrolmessage) which
accompanies a downstream over-the-air message, with information for
one or more frequency segments. Similarly, a *compat2* radio model
uses the [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage) to define one or
more frequency groups, each of which containing information for one or
more frequency segments, where each transmit antenna is associated
with one of the defined frequency groups.

Frequency segment information includes the segment center frequency,
total time duration, offset from the transmission time stamp and
optionally, transmit power in dBm that overrides any overall
transmitter power level.

Frequency information is included in the *Common Physical Layer
Header* and divided into two parts, frequency group segments:
`frequencyGroups[j].frequencySegments[j].{frequencyHz,
offsetMicroseconds, durationMicroseconds}` and transmit antenna
frequency group association and bandwidth:
`transmitAntennas[i].{frequencyGroupIndex, bandwidthHz}`.

At the receiving *NEM*, depending on its noise mode, one of four
actions will be taken for all segments where the $$rxPower >
rxSensitivity$$:

1. If `noisemode` is `all`, the signal energy for each frequency
   segment will be applied to the spectrum monitor based on frequency
   of interest bandwidth overlap.

2. If `noisemode` is `outofband` and this is an out-of-band
   transmission, the signal energy for each frequency segment will be
   applied to the spectrum monitor based on frequency of interest
   bandwidth overlap.

3. If `noisemode` is `outofband` and this is an in-band transmission,
   no energy will be applied to the spectrum monitor.

4. If `noisemode` is `none`, no energy will be applied to the spectrum
   monitor.

A radio model will only receive those frequency segments where
$rxPower > rxSensitivity$. Any frequency segment that has a center
frequency that is not in the physical layer's frequency of interest
list will cause the entire transmission to be treated as out-of-band.

### Collaborative Transmission

The physical layer provides the ability to send a single over-the-air
message specifying multiple transmitters to minimize over-the-air
message processing during collaborative transmission. A radio model
can utilize this feature by populating the [`TransmitterControlMessage`](control-messages#transmittercontrolmessage), which accompanies a
downstream over-the-air message, with information for multiple
transmitters. Transmitter information includes the *NEM* id of the
transmitter and the transmission power, and is included in the *Common
Physical Layer Header*: `transmitters[i].{nemId, powerdBm}`.

It is the radio model's responsibility to implement the coordination
logic that allows one instance (*NEM*) to send the collaborative
over-the-air transmission.

Upon the reception of an over-the-air message with multiple
transmitters, the physical layer will calculate the $$rxPower$$
from each transmitter and sum up the energy. Depending on the current
noise mode, one of four actions will be taken, provided the $$\sum_{n=0}^{N} rxPower_n > rxSensitivity$$, where $$N$$ is the
number of transmitters:

1. If `noisemode` is `all`, the summed energy will be applied to the
   spectrum monitor based on frequency of interest bandwidth overlap.

2. If `noisemode` is `outofband` and this is an out-of-band message,
   the summed energy will be applied to the spectrum monitor based on
   frequency of interest bandwidth overlap.

3. If `noisemode` is `outofband` and this is an in-band message, no
   energy will be applied to the spectrum monitor.

4. If `noisemode` is `none`, no energy will be applied to the spectrum
   monitor.

Regardless of `noisemode`, the radio model will only receive the
over-the-air message when $$\sum_{n=0}^{N} rxPower_n >
rxSensitivity$$. The radio model will receive no indication that this
message was a collaborative transmission.

### Fading Model

The physical layer supports per source fading model selection that can
be modified via [`FadingSelectionEvents`](events#fadingselectionevent). Fading selection
is controlled by the `fading.model` configuration parameter and can be
one of either `none`, `event`, `nakagami`, or `lognormal`. Specifying
`event` requires using a [`FadingSelectionEvent`](events#fadingselectionevent) in order to assign
the fading model used at a receiving *NEM* for a specified *NEM*
source.

The Nakagami-m Fading model uses a gamma distribution to determine a
fade loss value based on distance and power. Configuration parameters
provide the ability to model various fading effects experienced in
both indoor and outdoor environments based on empirical
data. Parameters are used to specify two distance thresholds:
`fading.nakagami.distance0` and `fading.nakagami.distance1` (meters)
in order to establish three distance bounds: *below*, *between*, and
*above*; and three shape factors corresponding to the three distance
bounds: `fading.nakagami.m0`, `fading.nakagami.m1`, and
`fading.nakagami.m2`.

The Lognormal Fading model models Free Space Optical (FSO) loss using
a statistical mechanism. The Lognormal Fading model works by creating
a constant series of fades, each having a constant fade depth that may
contribute to over-the-air loss. The fading model keeps track of the
time each fading period ends and generates a new fading period upon
the arrival of the next over-ther-air message after the conclusion of
the current fading period. Fade depths are log normally distributed
but constant during a given fading period. Fade lengths are normally
distributed.
    
Lognormal Fading model configuration parameters are used to relate the
fading depth to pathloss in order to cause a corresponding amount of
over-the-air loss. There is an inverse relationship between fading
depth and pathloss, where lower values for fading depth result in 100%
loss, while higher values result in no loss. For values between no
loss and full loss, linear interpolation is used to calculate the
corresponding pathloss which may result in random loss during the
fading period.

### MIMO

The physical layer supports MIMO by allowing simultaneous use of
multiple transmit and receive antenna. Waveform implementation
specifics are modeled within the radio model, with control messages:
[`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage) and [`MIMOReceivePropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimoreceivepropertiescontrolmessage) conveying transmit
and receive information between layers, respectively.

Using MIMO API control messages, a radio model can define any number
of receive antenna (ideal omni or antenna profile defined), and
similarly, add multiple transmit antenna to each over-the-air
transmission. Every received over-the-air message will be processed
once for each receive path, where the total number of receive paths is
equal to the number of transmit antenna multiplied by the number of
receive antenna.

Receive antennas are added using [`RxAntennaAddControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaaddcontrolmessage), updated with [`RxAntennaUpdateControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaupdatecontrolmessage), and removed using [`RxAntennaRemoveControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaremovecontrolmessage). When adding a receive
antenna, a unique antenna index must be specified along with the
frequency of interest information for the antenna and the antenna
type: ideal omni (fixed gain) or antenna pattern defined (profile id
and pointing). The unique index value supplied during [`RxAntennaAddControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaaddcontrolmessage) is how an antenna is
referenced during an update or remove. It is also how per antenna
receive power information is identified when communicating received
over-the-air transmissions to the radio model via [`MIMOReceivePropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimoreceivepropertiescontrolmessage).

When sending an over-the-air transmission, a radio model specifies one
or more transmit antenna along with one or more groups of frequency
segments using [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage). Each transmit
antenna may be mapped to its own unique group of frequency segments or
share a group with other transmit antennas. Each transmit antenna is
specified using a unique antenna index value which is unrelated to
indexes used when adding receive antennas via [`RxAntennaAddControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaaddcontrolmessage).

A radio model is free to use the same index for receive and transmit
antennas to create its own logical association of the same antenna
being used for both receive and transmit. The physical layer does not
store any transmit antenna information in the downstream direction. In
the upstream (receive) direction, the physical layer caches computed
gain information when using antenna profiles, so it is important to be
consistent when indexing transmit antennas when sending over-the-air
transmissions. For example, if *NEM* 1 has antenna *A1* and antenna
*A2*, where *A1* is pointing at *(Az1,El1)* and *A2* is pointing at
*(Az2,El2)*, sending over-the-air transmissions and alternating or
changing transmit antenna indexes while not updating position and/or
pointing, will defeat any possible receive side caching gains which
are keyed off of transmit antenna index. Pick indexes for *A1* and
*A2*, then be consistent so receiving physical layers do not
invalidate cached antenna gains unless actual position and/or pointing
updates dictate so.

#### Creating Antennas

When using [`RxAntennaAddControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaaddcontrolmessage) to add receive
antenna, one of the following methods to create antenna instances should be used:

1. [`Antenna::createDefault()`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/antenna.h#L70): Creates a default antenna which
   will either be an ideal omni with a fixed gain or a profile defined
   antenna, based on the physical layer `fixedantennagainenable`
   configuration parameter -- *compat1* mechanism for using the
   default antenna.

2. [`Antenna::createIdealOmni()`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/antenna.h#L72): Creates an
   ideal omni antenna with a specified fixed gain.

3. [`Antenna::createProfileDefined()`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/antenna.h#L75):
   Creates an antenna profile defined antenna with an optional initial
   pointing.

If the newly created receive antenna does not have it's bandwidth set,
the physical layer will use the value from its
`bandwidth` configuration parameter.

If the [`RxAntennaAddControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaaddcontrolmessage)
  contains an empty frequency of interest set, the physical layer will
  use the value(s) from its `frequencyofinterest` configuration
  parameter.

When sending a [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage), use one of the
following methods to create the transmit antenna:


1. [`Antenna::createIdealOmni()`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/antenna.h#L72): Creates an
   ideal omni antenna with a specified fixed gain.

2. [`Antenna::createProfileDefined()`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/antenna.h#L75):
   Creates an antenna profile defined antenna with an optional initial
   pointing.

Use an empty antenna set when creating a [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage) to indicate use of
the default antenna configuration, which follows the same assignment
logic as [`Antenna::createDefault()`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/antenna.h#L70).

If the newly created antenna does not have it's bandwidth set, the
physical layer will use the value from its `bandwidth` configuration
parameter.

If any frequency segment has a 0 Hz specified frequency, the physical
layer will use the value from its `frequency` configuration parameter.

If any frequency segment does not specify a transmit power, the
physical layer will use the value from its `txpower` configuration
parameter.

#### Antenna Profiles and Pointing

MIMO API radio models (*compat2*) using antenna profiles must specify
pointing information in every over-the-air transmission as part of
[`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage). The MIMO
compatible physical layer supports event compatibility with *compat1*
radio models using external [`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) events. Where, the
[`AntennaProfileEvent`](events#antennaprofileevent) allows for specifying profile and
pointing information for a single antenna (always index 0) for each
specified *NEM*.

When using the MIMO API to point and transmit simultaneously, and
modeling a logical re-pointing of the same antenna for receive, you
must specify both a [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage) and a [`RxAntennaUpdateControlMessage`](control-messages#rxantennaupdatecontrolmessage) in order for the pointing
to take effect for receive.

### Doppler

The physical layer calculates and applies Doppler shift when
transmitter and receiver location and velocity are known at the
receiver, and the `dopplershiftenable` configuration parameter is set
to `on`. Doppler shift is applied when energy is added to spectrum
monitor bins based on bandwidth overlap. Doppler shift information is
communicated to *compat2* radio models via the
`MIMOReceivePropertiesControlMessage` as a mapping of center
frequencies and their corresponding shift, both in Hz.

### Spectral Masks

The physical layer provides support for using spectral masks to model
the effects of transmitters that radiate energy at frequencies (side
lobes and spurs) outside their defined bandwidth (main lobe/beam).  A
spectral mask manifest defines one or more spectral masks, where the
spectral mask manifest is defined using the emulator configuration
parameter: `spectralmaskmanifesturi`.

<param name="spectralmaskmanifesturi" value="spectralmasks.xml"/>

If spectral masks are being used by one or more *NEMs* within the
emulation, the `spectralmaskmanifesturi` configuration parameter must
be configured for all emulator instances, including those instances
with an *NEM* not transmitting with a spectral mask. This is necessary
for a receiving *NEM* to determine the *txPower* when performing the
[receive power calculation](#receive-power-calculation).

A spectral mask is composed of a primary signal and zero or more
spurs. Each spectral mask must have a unique non-zero id.

```xml
<spectral-mask-manifest>
  <mask id='1'>
    <primary>
      <width hz='1M' dBr='0'/>
    </primary>
  </mask>
  <mask id='2'>
    <primary>
      <width hz='500K' dBr='-60'/>
      <width hz='500K' dBr='-30'/>
      <width hz='1M' dBr='0'/>
      <width hz='500K' dBr='-30'/>
      <width hz='500K' dBr='-60'/>
    </primary>
  </mask>
  <mask id='3'>
    <primary>
      <width hz='500K' dBr='-60'/>
      <width hz='500K' dBr='-30'/>
      <width hz='1M' dBr='0'/>
      <width hz='500K' dBr='-30'/>
      <width hz='500K' dBr='-60'/>
     </primary>
     <spurs>
      <spur offset_from_center_hz='1G'>
        <width hz='10K' dBr='10'/>
      </spur>
     </spurs>
  </mask>
</spectral-mask-manifest>

```

1. Both `<primary>` and `<spur>` elements are defined using one or
   more contiguous segments specified in length (Hz) and a reference
   power offset (dBr) to be applied to the received signal relative to
   receiver bandwidth overlap.

2. `<spur>` elements contain an offset from the center transmit
   frequency in Hz.

By default, the physical layer uses a square mask across the entire
transmit bandwidth. When using spectral masks, the transmit bandwidth
is determined at the receiver to be the total width defined by the
respective mask element segments.

*Compat1* and *compat2* radio models can use the physical layer
configuration parameter `spectralmaskindex` to set the spectral mask
in use when transmitting. *Compat2* radio models can dynamically set
the transmit antenna spectral mask [`MIMOTransmitPropertiesControlMessage`](control-messages#mimotransmitpropertiescontrolmessage). Transmit antenna
spectral mask index is contained in the *Common Physical Layer
Header*: `transmitAntennas[i].spectralMaskIndex`

### Spectrum Filters

The physical layer provides a radio model with the ability to specify
one or more spectrum filters which record spectrum energy based on a
set of specified criteria. Filter spectrum windows are queried similar
to spectrum energy windows, and are used in conjunction with spectrum
energy windows to perform actions such as excision and cancellation.

A radio model adds one or more spectrum filters using [`SpectrumFilterAddControlMessage`](control-messages#spectrumfilteraddcontrolmessage) within a downstream
control message:

```cpp
sendDownstreamControl({SpectrumFilterAddControlMessage::create(1, // unique filter index
                                                               0, // antenna index
                                                               1000000000, // center freq
                                                               20000000, // bandwidth
                                                               100000, // sub-band width in hz           
                                                               BandwidthFilterElementLessEqual::create(100000)
                                                               )});


```

Spectrum filters are added per receive antenna using a unique filter
index for a given center frequency (Hz) and bandwidth (hz), along with
an optional sub-band width (Hz) length that subdivides spectral energy
into sub-band width bins of specified size for each time bin in the
filter energy window. Additionally, optional match criteria can be
supplied to allow for more precise control of which energy is
captured.

A radio model removes one or more spectrum filters using [`SpectrumFilterRemoveControlMessage`](control-messages#spectrumfilterremovecontrolmessage) within a downstream
control message:

```cpp
sendDownstreamControl({SpectrumFilterRemoveControlMessage::create(1, // unique filter index
                                                                  0)}); // antenna index

```

By default, filters do not record energy with the same `subid` as
their associated physical layer (in-band waveform). Set the physical
layer confiugration parameter `excludesamesubidfromfilterenable` to
`false` to allow filter processing of in-band spectrum energy and add
`SubIdFilterElementEqual::create(0)` to the `FilterMatchCriterion`
expression. Where, subid 0 means match the radio model's associated
physical layer subid.

Match criteria may be specified using any combination of the following:

* [`FrequencyFilterElementLess`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/filtermatchcriterion.h#L189)

* [`SubIdFilterElementGreaterEqual`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/filtermatchcriterion.h#L267)

* [`FilterDataFilterElementNotEqual`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/filtermatchcriterion.h#L287)

More complex compound expressions are created using:

* [`FilterMatchCriterionAnd`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/filtermatchcriterion.h#L124)
* [`FilterMatchCriterionOr`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/filtermatchcriterion.h#L147)
* [`FilterMatchCriterionNot`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/filtermatchcriterion.h#L169)

*Filter data* is opaque data a radio model can attach to a downstream
over-the-air transmission to allow additional match criteria. This
opaque data can be used in conjunction with a custom [`FilterMatchCriterion`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/filtermatchcriterion.h#L60) expression, or with
[`FilterDataFilterElementEqual`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/filtermatchcriterion.h#L282) or
[`FilterDataFilterElementNotEqual`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/filtermatchcriterion.h#L287).

```cpp
SpectrumFilterAddControlMessage::create(2, // Filter Index
                                        2347000000, // Freq 1GHz
                                        20000000, // 20 MHz bandwidth
                                        0, // no sub-bands
                                        FilterDataFilterElementEqual::create("Hello World!"));

```

A radio model uses the [`SpectrumFilterDataControlMessage`](control-messages#spectrumfilterdatacontrolmessage) to add *filter data*
when sending a downstream packet:

```cpp
sendDownstreamPacket(CommonMACHeader{type_, u16SequenceNumber_++},
                   pkt,
                   {Controls::SpectrumFilterDataControlMessage::create("Hello World!"),
                    ...
                   })

```

A radio model queries spectrum filter energy using
[`SpectrumServiceProvider::requestAntennaFilter`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/spectrumserviceprovider.h#L208):

```cpp
auto windowFilter =
  pRadioService_->spectrumService().requestAntennaFilter(0, // antenna index
                                                         1, // unique filter index
                                                         span,
                                                         startOfReception);

```

Where, the returned filter window is a [`SpectrumFilterWindow`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/spectrumserviceprovider.h#L78) instance.  In this
example, the filter was added with a sub-band width causing the energy
values contained in the spectrum window to be:

```text
[T_0_SUB_0,TO_SUB_1,...,TO_SUB_N,T1_SUB_0,T1_SUB_1,...,T1_SUB_N,...]

```

The number of sub-band entries per time bin (`N`) is returned as the
last item in the [`windowFilter`](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/blob/master/include/emane/spectrumserviceprovider.h#L78) tuple:

```cpp
auto subBandBinCount = std::get<4>(windowFilter);

```



## Platform Orientation

The physical layer accounts for the transmitting and receiving *NEM's*
platform orientation when determining the antenna gain based on
antenna profiles.

Location Events are required when using antenna profiles and
each event includes the following 3 elements for a given *NEM*:

1. *position* - latitude, longitude, altitude (required)
 
2. *velocity* - azimuth, elevation, magnitude (optional, defaults to 0)
 
3. *orientation* - pitch, roll, yaw (optional, defaults to 0)

The *position* element identifies the platform’s location and not the
antenna location, as a given platform may have more than one
antenna. In cases where a platform has multiple antenna and their
location on the platform needs to be accounted for, the
*\<placement\>* element within the antenna manifest is utilized to
define the offset of each antenna relative to the platform’s
position. The *velocity* element identifies the speed and direction of
the platform relative to true north.

![](images/velocityvector.png){:width="60%"; .centered}

*Orientation* defines the pitch, roll and yaw angles (Euler angels)
 about the platform’s latitudinal, longitudinal and vertical axes
 respectively. Yaw and pitch are defined relative to the velocity
 vector’s azimuth and elevation components respectively and roll is
 defined relative to wings level position.

![](images/rollpitchyaw.png){:width="60%"; .centered}

The arrow directions indicate positive angles.

29. **`processingpoolsize`**: Defines the number of processing pool
    threads. If > 2, pool threads are used to process receive paths per

    segments and/or a large number of transmit antenna (MIMO). Without a
    processing pool, receive paths are calculated serially in a loop.
    There is a threshold where serial processing is faster than the
    context switching of the thread pool.  Additionally, if the number of
    cores available to a running emane process is less than the processing
    pool size, worse performance may be encountered.
