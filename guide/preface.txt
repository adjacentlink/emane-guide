## Who This Guide Is For

The *emane-guide* is for anyone interested in using the [*Extendable
Mobile Ad-hoc Network
Emulator*](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane) (*EMANE*) for
research and development of wireless communication systems.

The *emane-guide* assumes that you are familiar with basic wireless
communication concepts and have a working knowledge of the Linux
command line. The material presented throughout the guide is done in a
broadly accessible manner. Networking tools and operating system
components, such as Linux Containers, are used throughout the
accompanying examples. If you find that you require more information
or direction using any of these, there is ample documentation readily
available on the Internet.

## How to Use This Guide

The *emane-guide* is designed to be read in sequence, with each
chapter building on the previous. The *emane-guide* comes with a set
of examples, so you will want to clone the latest version from
[GitHub](https://github.com) and give each a try.

~{{verbatim type=txt --
$ git clone https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane-guide}}~

Some sections of the guide that focus on internal and external APIs
will make more sense if you have a programming background,
specifically experience with C++, Python, and Google Protocol
Buffers. None of which are a prerequisite for using *EMANE*, but if
you want to develop radio models or tools that interact with *EMANE*,
proficiency with each will be helpful.

Additional Adjacent Link tutorials related to material and topics
referenced the *emane-guide* are as follows:

* The
  [*emane-control-port-tutorial*](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane-control-port-tutorial)
  is a deep-dive into understanding how to interface with the *EMANE*
  Control Port.

* The
  (*letce2-tutorial*)[https://github.com/adjacentlink/letce2-tutorial]
  provides an overview of the *Lightweight Experiment Template
  Configuration Environment* (*letce2*) and covers how to define and
  execute experiments.

* The
  [*python-etce-tutorial*](https://github.com/adjacentlink/python-etce-tutorial)
  provides an overview of the *Extendable Test Control Environment*
  (*ETCE*). *ETCE* concepts are introduced through a sequence of
  examples. The tutorial aims to explain ETCE with enough detail so
  that users can effectively write, execute and automate their own
  *EMANE* emulations upon completion.

* The [*EMANE*
  Wiki](https://https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane/wiki) and
  [*emane-tutorial*](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane-tutorial)
  are the original *EMANE* guide. Both of which have been replaced
  with this guide. However this guide is still in its infancy, so
  there may be material in the wiki and tutorial that is not yet
  included in this guide.
