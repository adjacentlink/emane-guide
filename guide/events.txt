# Events

A scenario is a set of *events* that are sent to one or more *NEMs* in
order to change environmental characteristics such as locations,
pathloss and antenna pointing. Events are delivered opaquely to
registered radio model and physical layer instances allowing
individual radio models to use their own specialized events when
necessary.

Events are defined using [Google Protocol
Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) and transmitted to emulator instances
via the multicast event channel or in some special circumstances via
the multicast over-the-air channel. Events on the over-the-air channel
are referred to as *attached events* because they are attached to
specific over-the-air messages. The *attached event* mechanism is used
by a small subset of *compat1* radio models to issue antenna profile
events that are required to be processed before their respective
over-the-air message. The vast majority of radio models do not use
*attached events* and the MIMO API (*compat2*) makes using *attached
events* for antenna profile control unnecessary.

*EMANE* provides two mechanisms for generating events and injecting
them into a running emulation: event generator plugins using the
~{{link name="Event Service" file="applications.md"
section="#event-service"}}~ and applications using the Python
`emane.events` module.

The ~{{link name="Emulation Event Log Generator"
file="eel-event-generator.md" section="#eel-event-generator"}}~ for
the ~{{link name="Event Service" file="applications.md"
section="#event-service"}}~ provides a time based input sentence
syntax for defining emulation events and is discussed in detail in a
later ~{{link name="section" file="eel-event-generator.md"
section="#eel-event-generator"}}~.

The Python `emane.events` module provides an event class for each of
the standard *EMANE* events and an `EventService` class for sending
and receiving events. The following sections detail each of the
standard *EMANE* events along with Python usage examples and command
line tools that are available for quick event injection.

You can also use event protocol buffer
definitions to develop your own tools that generate and send
events. The
[emane-example-cpp-events](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane-example-cpp-events)
project is an example of doing just that in C++.

## Monitoring Events

It can be beneficial to monitor events in order to determine why an
emulation may not be executing as intended. Events can be monitored in
a number of way: using the *EMANE* shell (`emanesh`) to inspect
individual event reception tables; using OpenTestPoint to monitor all
event reception tables of all nodes in an emulation, or using
`emaneevent-dump` to listen and display event contents transmitted via
the event and over-the-air channels.

Depending on the scale of your emulation and your reason for
monitoring events, some monitoring methods may be more appropriate
than others. As we discuss event monitoring, you can try any of the
following examples yourself using a running ~{{link name="`rfpipe-01`"
file="rf-pipe-radio-model.md" section="#rfpipe-01"}}~ example. Don't
worry about what the nodes in the example are doing. For now we are
only interested in events.

The `emaneevent-dump` application listens on an interface for events
and displays the Python representation of received event data. If you
are trying this yourself with `rfpipe-01`, you might miss the event
sent at the start of the example. You can send events with any of the
example scripts in `emane-guide/examples/event-01/scripts` and see
them with `emaneevent-dump`. The examples below are after executing
the `send-location-event.py` script.

~{{verbatim type=txt --
$ emaneevent-dump -i letce0
[1694014118.758490] nem: 0 event: 100 len: 33 seq: 1 [Location]
 UUID: 8e156854-12c9-42eb-9d56-f2e5bfb771af
   (1, {'latitude': 37.274043, 'longitude': -115.79903, 'altitude': 10.0})}}~

~{{warnbox If you are not seeing any events, you might have to set
letce0 to be a trusted interface: sudo firewall-cmd --zone=trusted
--change-interface=letce0}}~


The `emanesh` application can query a running `emane` instance to view
statistics and statistic tables.

~{{verbatim type=txt --
$ emanesh node-1 get table nems phy EventReceptionTable
nem 1   phy EventReceptionTable
| Event | Total Rx |
| 100   | 1        |
| 101   | 1        |
}}~

The Physical Layer `EventReceptionTable` keeps a count of all received
events by event id.

| Event Id  | Event Name            |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| 100       | Location              |
| 101       | Pathloss              |
| 102       | Antenna Profile       |
| 103       | Comm Effect           |
| 104       | IEEE802.11abg One Hop |
| 105       | TDMA Schedule         |
| 106       | Fading Selection      |

OpenTestPoint probes for *EMANE* publish statistic and statistic table
measurements on OpenTestPoint time boundaries, once every 5
seconds. An easy way to view a correlated table of
`EventReceptionTable` entries from all nodes is to use
`otestpoint-labtools-mtabletool`.

~{{verbatim type=txt --
$ otestpoint-labtools-mtabletool \
    localhost:9002 \
    Measurement_emane_physicallayer_tables_events@eventreceptiontable \
    EMANE.PhysicalLayer.Tables.Events \
    --actions \
    "pass(c=(0));" \
    "pass(c=(1))=>|Total|};" \
    --pivot "values=(2),index=(0),cols=(1);"}}~

Which will produce a periodically updated long-form table of per node event
counts pivoted on event id.

~{{verbatim type=txt --
 Measurement_emane_physicallayer_tables_events@eventreceptiontable
            Total
Event        100 101
_Publisher
node-1         1   1
node-2         1   1
node-3         1   1
node-4         1   1
node-5         1   1}}~

## AntennaProfileEvent

An `AntennaProfileEvent` is used to set the antenna profile and
pointing information (azimuth and elevation) for an *NEM's* default
antenna (index 0).

*NEMs* must know the antenna profile and pointing information for
themselves and/or any other *NEMs* that have their physical layer
~{{link name="configuration parameters" file="physical-layer.md"
section="#configuration"}}~ set accordingly:

1. `compatibilitymode` is `1`
2. `fixedanntennagainenable` is `off`

~{{file path="$emane_SRC_ROOT/src/libemane/antennaprofileevent.proto"
type=protobuf
showname=true
blank=false
skip=33
path-cut="$emane_SRC_ROOT"
path-replace="emane"}}~

The following example uses the `emane.events` Python module to send
antenna profile updates for two *NEMs* to all  *NEMs*.

~{{file path="../examples/events-01/scripts/send-antenna-profile-event.py"
   type=python
   skip=32
   showname=true
   blank=true
   path-cut="../examples"
   path-replace="emane-guide/examples"}}~

The `emaneevent-antennaprofile` command line tool can be used to set a
single antenna profile and pointing for one or more *NEMs*. See
`emaneevent-antennaprofile --help` for more information.

~{{verbatim type=txt --
$ emaneevent-antennaprofile 1 profile=1 azimuth=291.11372919270093 elevation=69.66042286291453 -i letce0}}~

## LocationEvent

A `LocationEvent` is used to set the location and optionally the
velocity and/or orientation of an *NEM*.

*NEMs* must know the location of all other *NEMs* if any of the
following physical layer ~{{link name="configuration parameters"
file="physical-layer.md" section="#configuration"}}~ are set
accordingly:

1. `propagationmodel` is `2ray` or `freespace`
2. `fading.model` is `event`, `nakagami`, or `lognormal`
3. `dopplershiftenable` is `on`
4. `fixedanntennagainenable` is `off`

~{{file path="$emane_SRC_ROOT/src/libemane/locationevent.proto"
type=protobuf
showname=true
blank=false
skip=33
path-cut="$emane_SRC_ROOT"
path-replace="emane"}}~

The following example uses the `emane.events` Python module to send a
location update for a single *NEM*.

~{{file path="../examples/events-01/scripts/send-location-event.py"
   type=python
   skip=32
   showname=true
   blank=true
   path-cut="../examples"
   path-replace="emane-guide/examples"}}~

The `emaneevent-location` command line tool can be used to set a
single position, with an optional velocity and/or orientation, as the
position for one or more *NEMs*. See `emaneevent-location --help` for
more information.

~{{verbatim type=txt --
$ emaneevent-location 1 latitude=37.274043 longitude=-115.799030 altitude=10.0 -i letce0}}~

## PathlossEvent

A `PathlossEvent` is used to set the pathloss used at a receiving
*NEM* for over-the-air transmissions from one or more specified source
*NEMs*. 

*NEMs* must know the pathloss for transmitting *NEMs* if any of the
following physical layer ~{{link name="configuration parameters"
file="physical-layer.md" section="#configuration"}}~ are set
accordingly:

1. `propagationmodel` is `precomuted`

~{{file path="$emane_SRC_ROOT/src/libemane/pathlossevent.proto"
type=protobuf
showname=true
blank=false
skip=33
path-cut="$emane_SRC_ROOT"
path-replace="emane"}}~

The following example uses the `emane.events` Python module to send a
pathloss update to *NEMs* 1 through 3 to place them in a straight
line. If a previous pathloss event enabled *NEM* 1 and *NEM* 3 to see
each other, the script should be modified to add a sufficiently large
enough pathloss between the two to prevent direct communication.

~{{file path="../examples/events-01/scripts/send-pathloss-event.py"
   type=python
   skip=32
   showname=true
   blank=true
   path-cut="../examples"
   path-replace="emane-guide/examples"}}~

The physical layer ignores any self-pathloss information, so you can
avoid having to create separate event objects to change the
bidirectional pathloss between two nodes.

The `emaneevent-pathloss` command line tool can be used to set the
pathloss between one or more *NEMs*. See `emaneevent-pathloss --help`
for more information.

~{{verbatim type=txt --
$ emaneevent-pathloss 1:5 200 -i letce0}}~

## FadingSelectionEvent

A `FadingSelectionEvent` is used to set the fading model in use at a
receiving *NEM* for over-the-air transmission from one or more
specified source *NEMs*.

*NEMs* must know the fading model selection for transmitting *NEMs* if
the receiving *NEM* has its physical layer ~{{link name="configuration
parameters" file="physical-layer.md" section="#configuration"}}~ set
accordingly:

1. `fading.model` is `event`

~{{file path="$emane_SRC_ROOT/src/libemane/fadingselectionevent.proto"
type=protobuf
showname=true
blank=false
skip=33
path-cut="$emane_SRC_ROOT"
path-replace="emane"}}~

The following example uses the `emane.events` Python module to send a
fading model selection to all *NEMs*, selecting `nakagami` for all
received traffic from *NEMs* 1 through 5.

~{{file path="../examples/events-01/scripts/send-fading-selection-event.py"
   type=python
   skip=32
   showname=true
   blank=true
   path-cut="../examples"
   path-replace="emane-guide/examples"}}~

The `emaneevent-fadingselection` command line tool can be used to set
the fading selection used at receiving *NEMs* for messages from
transmitting *NEMs*. See `emaneevent-fadingselection --help` for more
information.

~{{verbatim type=txt --
$ emaneevent-fadingselection 1:5 nakagami -i letce0}}~
